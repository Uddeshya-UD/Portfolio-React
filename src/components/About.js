        <strong>Hi I'm Uddeshya verma </strong>
         , a software developer with a passion for coding and problem-solving. With over 2 years of experience, I have expertise in Java, Python, Golang, Javascript, SpringBoot, ReactJS and SQL. I'm also skilled in AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, Testing, and Documentation.

I am a B Tech Graduate in Computer Science, where I gained a solid foundation in programming. I love creating unique and visually appealing websites, and you can check out my projects on my personal page.

<br/><br/>Apart from programming, I have a strong interest in music. I have received 2 years of classical singing training and enjoy expressing my creativity through singing. Gaming is another one of my hobbies, and I find that it enhances my problem-solving and critical thinking skills.

<br/><br/>Overall, I'm a dedicated software developer with a knack for staying updated with industry trends. I'm enthusiastic about contributing to innovative projects and working with a dynamic team. If you have any exciting opportunities or projects, I'd love to hear about them!
